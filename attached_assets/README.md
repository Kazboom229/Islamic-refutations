## Presentation Content

The presentation is organized into several key sections:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of energy conservation principles
2. **Physics Arguments**: Evidence from quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology
3. **Philosophical Arguments**: Logical and metaphysical analysis challenging absolutism
4. **Formal Logic**: Advanced logical frameworks examining energy conservation
5. **Conclusion**: Reframing energy conservation as a contextual principle
